# holbertonschool-system_linux

## Description
Linux component of the Holberton school "Low-Level and Algorithms" specialization curriculum. One directory per project, mandatory tasks are files `?-*.c`, advanced tasks `???-*.c`.

---

### [(308) 0x00. C - ls](./0x00-ls/)
Building a clone of the Linux function `ls`.

### [(322) 0x01. C - Static variables, getline](./0x01-getline/)
Introduction to static variables in C and building a clone of the glibc function `getline`.

### [(327) 0x02. C - Shell v2](./0x02-shell_v2/)
Revisiting (235) 0x16. C - Simple Shell to build a second clone of `dash` / Ubuntu `sh`, now with logical operators, piping, and input/output redirections.

Project 0x02 found in separate repository [`shell_v2/`](https://github.com/allelomorph/shell_v2).

### [(360) 0x03. Python - /proc filesystem](./0x03-proc_filesystem/)
Introduction to using the `/proc` filesystem to explore the memory footprint of a running process.

### [(364) 0x04. C - ELF: readelf](./0x04-readelf/)
Introduction to ELF or the Executable and Linkable Format, its uses, and structure.

### [(376) 0x05. x86 Assembly - libASM](./0x05-libasm/)
Introduction to x86 assembly: Intel vs AT&T, flag registers, stack frames, function and system calls.

### [(362) 0x06. C - Signals](./0x06-signals/)
Introduction to Unix signals: sending, listening, and catching.

### [(369) 0x07. C - ELF: nm/objdump](./0x07-nm_objdump/)
Continued exploration of ELF structures, now in building clones of `nm` and `objdump`.

### [(277) 0x08. CPython](./0x08_CPython/)
An investigation into how Python 3 is implemented in C and how to access it via its C API.

### [(393) 0x09. C - Strace](./0x09-strace/)
Learning more about syscalls and registers, and the use of the `ptrace` library through cloning behavior of `strace`.

### [(442) 0x0A. Multithreading](./0x0A-multithreading/)
Introduction to the `pthread` library and concepts like concurrency vs parallelism, mutual exclusion, and race conditions.

### [(374) 0x0B. C - malloc](./0x0B-malloc/)
Investigating virtual memory and the heap by building clones of the glibc `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`.

Project 0x0B found in separate repository [`malloc/`](https://github.com/allelomorph/malloc).

### [(441) 0x0C. Sockets](./0x0C-sockets/)
